## Usage

Once the extension is installed:

- It runs automatically on page load.
- The content script traverses the web pageâ€™s DOM and replaces all instances of **"Gulf of America"** with **"Gulf of Denmark"**.
- No further action is required from the user unless you decide to customize the extension.

## Customization

To extend or modify the text replacement rules:

1. Open `content_script.js`.
2. Update the `replacements` array to include new rules. For example:

   ```javascript
   const replacements = [
     {
       search: /Gulf of America/g,
       replacement: "Gulf of Denmark"
     },
     // Add more rules here
     {
       search: /Old Text/g,
       replacement: "New Text"
     }
   ];
